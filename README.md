# amplifier-module-hooks-status-context

Status context injection hook module for Amplifier. Injects fresh git status and current date/time into the agent's context before each prompt submission.

## Purpose

Provides the agent with up-to-date contextual information about:

- **Current date and time** (local timezone)
- **Git repository status** (branch, changes, commits)

This ensures the agent always has fresh status information when making decisions or providing responses.

## Usage

Add to your profile's hooks section:

```yaml
hooks:
  - module: hooks-status-context
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-module-hooks-status-context@main
    config:
      # Git options (all default to true)
      include_git: true
      git_include_status: true
      git_include_commits: 5
      git_include_branch: true
      git_include_main_branch: true

      # Datetime options
      include_datetime: true
      datetime_include_timezone: false # Set to true to include timezone name
```

## Configuration Options

### Git Status Options

- `include_git` (default: `true`) - Enable/disable git context injection
- `git_include_status` (default: `true`) - Include working directory status (modified, added, deleted files)
- `git_include_commits` (default: `5`) - Number of recent commits to show (set to 0 to disable)
- `git_include_branch` (default: `true`) - Show current branch name
- `git_include_main_branch` (default: `true`) - Detect and show main/master branch

### Datetime Options

- `include_datetime` (default: `true`) - Enable/disable datetime injection
- `datetime_include_timezone` (default: `false`) - Include timezone name (e.g., "PST", "UTC")

### Hook Options

- `priority` (default: `0`) - Hook execution priority (lower = earlier)

## Example Outputs

### Datetime Injection

```
Current date and time: 2025-11-07 11:45:23
```

With timezone:

```
Current date and time: 2025-11-07 11:45:23 PST
```

### Git Status Injection

```
Git Status: This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.

Current branch: feature/status-hooks

Main branch (you will usually use this for PRs): main

Status:
M amplifier-core/amplifier_core/coordinator.py
?? test_hooks_demo.py

Recent commits:
c964339 chore: Update loop-basic submodule with context injection fix
3d94a63 fix: Add coordinator.process_hook_result() calls for context injection
a1b2c3d docs: Update hooks documentation
```

## How It Works

1. **Event Registration**: Hooks into `prompt:submit` event
2. **Context Gathering**: Collects enabled status information (datetime, git)
3. **Context Injection**: Returns `HookResult` with `action="inject_context"`
4. **Agent Awareness**: Agent sees injected context in its conversation history

## When to Use

Use this hook when you want the agent to have awareness of:

- Current time for scheduling or time-sensitive tasks
- Git repository state for code changes and PR workflows
- Branch information for suggesting where to commit

## Disabling Sections

To disable datetime only:

```yaml
config:
  include_datetime: false
```

To disable git only:

```yaml
config:
  include_git: false
```
